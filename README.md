# Planet-Physics-Test
I tried to create a real-time planetary system simulation using VPython. The program models a simple two-planet one-star system. The planets follow Newtonian Gravity, with their orbits dynamically calculated based on their distance from the sun.

### **Features**  
**Real-time simulation** of planetary motion  
**Background stars** to make it look more realistic  
**Orbit trails** (can be toggled on/off to reduce lag)  
**Pause & Resume button** (or press **spacebar**)  

### **How to Run**  
1. Install **VPython**:
2. Run the Script:
3. Press **Spacebar** to pause/resume.  
4. Click **"Disable Trails"** to remove orbit paths.  

### **Next Steps**  
- Maybe add **moons** orbiting the planets (I tried once and it broke really bad)
- Improve **orbit accuracy** using better physics
